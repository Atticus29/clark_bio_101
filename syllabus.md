   ###Textbooks and other resources

####Textbook- *Essential Environmental* (5th ed), by Withgott and Laposata
- Available at Clark College Bookstore
- Bring the textbook to class – we will use it during class time.
- **Note: If you are using an E book I will have you sit with someone who has a printed book while in class and lab.** 

####Computer Resources 
- There is a convenient computer lab in the library and a list of Clark College’s computer labs can be  accessed [here](http://www.clark.edu/campus-life/student-support/computing_resources/hours.php)
- Library Resources, Tutoring and Writing Center and Disability Support Services as well as other resources can be accessed on the [Clark College website](http://www.Clark.edu). 

####Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. You will be using this tool to gage your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet.

###Course Description
  Welcome to Biology 101 (Environmental Biology)! BIOL 101 is a five credit, introductory level course with no prerequisites. The objective of this course is to introduce you to a variety of environmental concepts using lectures, discussions, reading and writing assignments. 

Examples of topics that we will discuss include environmental issues and their roots, human population growth and its impact on natural systems, ecosystems, invasive species, water quality, biodiversity, and ecological restoration.

Environmental Biology Lab is part of this course and provides additional opportunities for exploring environmental topics through hands-on activities, in-depth discussions, and field activities. 

**This class meets 5 of your 15 science distribution credits for an Associate of Arts transfer degree.  **

####Philosophy and purpose of this course
 In this course you will have the opportunity to learn about and reflect on your impact on the environment. It is my hope that you make some lifestyle changes after you learn about your own ecological footprint. I believe we can all learn from each other so I encourage collaborative sharing of ideas (except during exams!). It is well known that we learn best by doing and experiencing, and that is where the interactive lab activities will further expand your understanding of the lecture concepts. I encourage you to come with an open mind!  
####Lab information
 Please note that the lab and conference are NOT separate entities from the lecture. One final grade is given for class and lab assignments. 

Labs focus on hands-on learning of key concepts.

Conferences will be used to introduce/review labs, take lecture tests and lab quizzes, and participate in additional activities and small group discussions.   It is my hope that you will feel comfortable in the small group setting of lab and conference to participate in interactive group discussion and share your opinions, ideas and thoughts with your fellow lab-mates. Through collaboration you will come to a more full understanding of your place in the environment and what role you can play in a sustainable future.
 ####ExpectationsScience doesn't come naturally to most people. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of time required to be successful. It is expected that you invest time into your coursework outside of the classroom. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading and study time. This means you should **carve out about 9 hours a week** to devote to reading, reviewing and completing assignments outside of the time spent with me in the classroom. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation. 

Your effort outside of class will be reflected in the quality of work you do and result in a corresponding grade. In other words, do not expect an “A” grade when you are not putting in the time/effort outside of the classroom to achieve “A” work. 
#####Specific student responsibilities 1.	You are responsible for knowing the due dates of assignments. 
2. If you miss lab, you are responsible for obtaining copies of handouts from other students. Handouts will not be brought to class a second time for those students who missed class.  3. You are responsible for knowing WHERE the lab is meeting on any particular day.  4.	You are responsible for knowing how you are doing in class. All points are cumulative. Keep  all papers (quizzes, exams, returned assignments) until the final grade is given. Instructors make grading mistakes, so it will benefit you to keep your own records.

1. Attendance
 Per university policy, attendance during the first week of class is mandatory. If you are absent during the first week and do not contact me, you will be dropped from the class. Attendance during the remainder of the term is critical to your success in this course. I will be taking attendance, and it will contribute to your participation grade (see below). The exams will focus on material covered in lecture, and the answers to the exam questions may not be available directly from the textbook.
2.	Class Preparation
 Success in this course depends not only on attendance, but also on effort. Many of the concepts that we will discuss will be unfamiliar to you. Much of the vocabulary will also be new. In order to make the most of class time, read over the assigned chapters or sections BEFORE the class and then re-read them more carefully DIRECTLY AFTER the class in which they are discussed. Waiting until right before a test to read the text is highly ineffective. You will not be able to contribute to class discussions and you will not likely recall the material when asked for in a test or quiz.  Student engagement and interaction is essential to this class. Throughout the quarter there will be in-class group activities and I will also be calling on students for responses to questions. Your interaction on these fronts will comprise your **participation grade**. 

3.	Study Suggestions
 In my experience, most introductory-level science classes are challenging because they typically introduce new terminology and concepts. It will be important to use study time wisely. Here is a list of suggestions:
			 	- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed). Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.  	- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during conference, lecture, or ask another student while you're studying.  	- Use the objectives at the beginning of each chapter AND the “Testing Your Comprehension questions” at the end of the chapter as a study guide. These review questions will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text.  	- Form study groups! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short teaching demos to each other on particular topics. 

4. Academic Honesty

	Academic honesty is required at all times. I have a ZERO tolerance for cheating policy. Anyone caught cheating will receive an “F” for the assignment and will likely be dropped from the course with a failing grade. If the cheating is discovered after the last drop date, the student receives an “F”. In addition, the student may be referred to the Office of the Vice President for further disciplinary action. 

	Cheating takes many forms, if you are not clear on what constitutes cheating (plagiarism, etc) ask me! Some quick examples of academic dishonesty include misrepresenting another student‘s work as your own or misrepresenting a community service assignment.5. Classroom Behavior
 	Modern technology is amazing, and in many instances it can be a tremendous learning asset. I'm not going to stop you from having or using these resources in class, and indeed will often leverage them to enhance your learning experience. However, sometimes the myriad temptations provided by having a phone, tablet, or laptop in front of you can compete with the course content for your attention. 

	There are several studies that demonstrate a dramatic decrease of retention when a learner tries to multi-task, so please be aware of this and be warned that YOU ARE NOT MIRACULOUSLY IMMUNE TO THIS EFFECT.
	If you are honest with yourself and find the temptation to great, I strongly recommend taking notes by hand.
	A respectful environment will be maintained at all times. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct online so you understand the student rights and responsibilities.

 6. Course Withdrawal
 	Students may drop a class and receive a “W” grade until the end of the 8th week of classes. After that, you will not be allowed to drop a class unless you get permission from the Dean. If you stop coming to class without officially withdrawing you will receive an “F”. Although you will not need my signature to drop this course, please email me to let me know if you have withdrawn as a courtesy. 7. Late Assignment Policy
 	Assignments worth over 10 points will be accepted with point deductions up to 1 week after the due date with a point penalty. Turn in late assignments in person to me. If turning in during any other time or location (I have a mailbox in **TODO**) make sure to have a time and date stamp on it. Each weekday, there will be a 10% point deduction, up to a 50% deduction after 5 weekdays. Assignments more than 1 week late (5 weekdays) will NOT be accepted. Personal action journals, eco-footprints and other items that are to be posted on online Forums or discussion boards will not be accepted late. 
	8. Missed Tests
 	There will be no make-up tests. The lowest test score will automatically be dropped. 	If class is canceled for any reason, then scheduled assignments, quizzes, and tests will be collected/taken at the next class period.    ###Graded items and grading scale
